AAA is a security framework that controls access to computers resources, enforces policies, and audits usage. The main idea behind this method of maintaining security is in network management and screening/tracking users while they are connected.

### Authentication

As an [[IAM]] tool, AAA compares a user's credentials with its database of stored credentials. 

### Authorization

After authentication the user is granted privileges to access certain areas of a network or system based on areas and sets of permissions stored in a database along with the user's identity.

### Accounting

After authorization, track the user's activity while the user is logged in to a network by tracing information such as how long they were logged in, the data they sent or received, their [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP]] addresss, [[URI]] they used, and the different services they accessed.
