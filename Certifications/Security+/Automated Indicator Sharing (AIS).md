Automated Indicator Sharing is a service the [[Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)|CISA]] provides to enable real-time exchange of machine-readable cyber threat indicators and defensive measures between public and private-sector organizations. AIS helps to protect the participants of the service and ultimately reduce the prevalence of cyberattacks.
