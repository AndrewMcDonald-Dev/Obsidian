LTE  is a standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals, based on the [[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)|GSM]]/[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)|EDGE]] and [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)|UMTS]]/[[High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)|HSPA]] standards. It improves on those standards capacity and speed by using a different radio interface and core network improvements. 

LTE has been called 3.95G because the initial standard did not meet the requirements for 4G. This was quickly rectified with the LTE+/LTE Advanced standard.

## LTE+

LTE+ also known as LTE Advanced was developed soon after LTE in order to make the standard directly compatible with the 4G standard.  Because of the confusion with the quick change of names, LTE+ is also known as 4.5G.

## LTE-A Pro

LTE Advancde Pro, also known as 4.9G is an evoluation of LTE+ cellular standard supporting data rates in excess of 3 Gbit/s using 32-carrier aggregation. In addition, it incorporates several new technologies associated with [[Cellular Network#5G|5G]], such as 256-QAM, Massive MIMO, LTE-Unlicensed and LTE IoT, that facilitated early migration of existing networks to enhancements promised with the full 5G standard.
