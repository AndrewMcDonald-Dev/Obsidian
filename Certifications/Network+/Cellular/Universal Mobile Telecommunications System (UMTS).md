UMTS is a 3G cellular system for networks based on the [[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)|GSM]] standard. It was a competitor to [[Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)|CDMA2000]] in certain parts of the world. Unlike [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)|EDGE]] and CDMA2000, UMTS requires new base stations and new frequency allocations.

UMTS supports up to 42 Mbit/s transfer rates when [[High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)#Evolved High Speed Packed Access (HSPA+)|HSPA+]] is implemented in the network. UMTS was succeeded by [[Long Term Evolution (LTE)|LTE/4G]].
