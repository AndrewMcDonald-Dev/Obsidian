CDMA is a [[Channel Access Method]] used by various radio communication technologies. CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel. This allows several users to share a band of frequencise. To permit this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs spread spectrum technology and a special coding scheme.

CDMA it the main technology that enables 2G and 3G cellular networks. The version of CDMA that is used for 2G is called CDMAONE and for 3G it is called CDMA2000.

A simple overview of a mobile phone cellular network utilizing CDMA would consist of the following:

- A network of radio base stations forming the base station subsystem.
- The core [[Circuit Switching|circuit switched network]] for handling voice calls and text
- A [[Packet Switching|packed swtiched network]] for handling mobile data
- The public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network

This model is very similar to the one used by [[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)|GSM]] which instead of utilizing CDMA instead uses frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA).
