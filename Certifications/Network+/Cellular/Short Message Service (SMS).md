Short Messaeg Service is a text messaging service component of most telephone, Internet and mobiles device systems. It uses standardized communication protocols that let mobile phones exchange short text messages, typically transmitted over cellular network. 

Originally this service was only to communicate [[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)|GSM]] phones but later included [[Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)|CDMA]] and DIgital AMPS; it has since been defined and supported on newer networks, including present-day 5G ones. 

Using SMS gateways, messages can be transmitted over the Internet through an SMSC, allowing communication to computers, fixed landlines, and satellite. [[Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)|MMS]] was later introduced as an uprade to SMS with "picture messaging" capabilities.
