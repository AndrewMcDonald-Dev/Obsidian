Weighted fair queueing is a network scheduling algorithm. WFQ is both a packet-based implementation of the [[Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS)|generalized processor sharing (GPS)]] policy, and a natural extension of [[Fair Queuing]]. Whereas fair queueing shares the link's capacity in equal subparts, weighted fair queueing allows schedulers to specify, for each flow, whihc fraction of the capacity will be given.

By regulating weighted fair queueing weights dynamically, WFQ can be utilized fro controlling the [[Quality of Service (QoS)]], for example, to achieve a guaranteed data rate.
