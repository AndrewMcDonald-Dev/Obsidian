A frame is a digital data transmission unit in computer networking and telecommunications. In [[Packet Switching|packet switched]] systems, a frame is a simple container for a single network packet. In other telecommunications systems, a frame is a repeated structure support time-division multiplexing.

In the [[OSI Model]] of computer networking, a frame is the protocol data unit at the [[OSI Model#Data Link|data link layer]]. Frames are the result of the final layer of encapsulation before the data is transmitted over the physical layer. A frame consists of the link layer headers followed by a [[Packet|packet]]. Each frame is separated by a interframe gap. 

Some example implementaions of a frame are Wi-Fi's MAC frame and an Ethernet frame.
