In the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)|IEEE]] 802 reference model of computer networking, the logical link control (LLC) data communication protocol layer is the upper sublayer of the [[OSI Model#Data Link|data link layer]] of the [[OSI Model]]. The LLC sublayer acts as an interface between the [[Medium Access Control (MAC)]] sublayer and the [[OSI Model#Network|network layer]].

The LCC sublayer provides [[Multiplexing|multiplexing]] mechanisms that make it possible for several network protocools to coexist within a multipoint network and to be transported over the same network medium. It can also provide [[OSI Model#Flow Control|flow control]] and automatic repeat request (ARQ) error management mechanisms.

The LCC was defined by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)|IEEE]] 802.2 with three types of services offered

- Unacknowledged connectionless mode services (mandatory)
- Connection mode services (optional)
- Acknowledged connectionless mode services (optional)
