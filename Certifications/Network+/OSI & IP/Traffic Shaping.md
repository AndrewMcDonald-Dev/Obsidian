Traffic shaping is a bandwidth management technique used on computer networks which delays some or all [[Datagram|datagrams]] to bring them into compliance with a desired traffic profile. Traffic shaping is used to optimize or guarantee performance, improve latency, or increase usable bandwidth for some kinds of packets by delaying other kinds.

Some controversial use cases for applicationn-based traffic shaping is bandwidth throttling or peer-to-peer file sharing traffic. Many application protocols use encryption to circumvent application-based traffic shaping.

If a link becomes utilized to the point where there is a significant level of congestion, latency can rise substantially. Traffic sahping can be used to prevent this from occurring and keep latency in check. Traffic shaping provides a means to control the volume of traffic being sent into a network in a specified period (bandwidth throttling) or the maximum rate at which the traffic is sent (rate limiting). This control may be accomplished in many ways and for many reasons; however traffic shaping is always achieved by delaying packets.
