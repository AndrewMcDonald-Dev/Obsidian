Fair queuing is a family of scheduling algorihtms used in soome process and network schedulers. The algorithm is designed to achieve fairness when a limited resource is shared, for example to prevent flows with large packets or processes that generate small jobs from consuming more throughput or CPU time than other flows or processes.

Fair queuing is implemented in some advanced [[Network Switch|network swtiches]] and [[Router|routers]]. Fair queuing uses one queue per packet flow and services them in rotation, such that each flow can obtain an equaly fraction of the resources.
