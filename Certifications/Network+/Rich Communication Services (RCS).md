This communication protocol was aimed to replace both [[Short Message Service (SMS)|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)|MMS]] which it eventually accomplished. The creation of this protocol started in 2007 but many version lacked interoperability, eventually a new specification named Universal Profile was developed and has been continually rolled out since 2017.

RCS was designed to be an industry open standard to provide improved capabilities over basic text messaging, based on the [[Internet Protocol Suite (TCP IP)#Internet Protocol (IP)|Internet Protocol (IP)]]. Its development has also been supported by mobile network operators ot regain their influence against individual chat apps and services. Features include presence information, location and multimedia sharing, video calling, and operation over mobile data or Wi-Fi, natively integrated in mobile phones without requiring the download of third-party apps. 

Currently, Google Messages on Android supports using RCS anywhere without carrier support and additionally offers end-to-end encryption. Apple plans to support RCS in Messages with iOS 18 in the fall of 2024.
