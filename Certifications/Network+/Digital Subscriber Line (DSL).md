DSL is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines. In telecommunication marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean [[Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)#Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)|ADSL]]. DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line since DSL uses higher frequency bands for data transmission.

A DSL connection can be deployed over existing cable making it an easy replacement to Dial-Up systems. Telephone companies were also under pressure to move to ADSL owing to competition from cable companies, which use [[Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)|DOCSIS cable modem]] technology to achieve similar speeds.

As ADSL has reached close to the end of its lifespan DOCSIS has become the pre-eminent technology as it can still offer faster and lower latency connections.


## Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)

In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction (the direction to the service provider) is lower, hence the designation of asymmetric service.
