This standard is one of the two major standards outlining the protocols for [[Cellular Network#2G|2G]]. The GSM standard originally described a digital, circuit-switched optimized for full duplex voice telephony. This expanded over time to include data communications, first by circuit switched transport, then by packet data transport via General Packed Radio Service (GPRS), and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)]]. 

GSM uses frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) technology and the general overview of a mobile phone cellular network using GSM would be:

- A network of radio base stations forming the base station subsystem.
- The core [[Circuit Switching|circuit switched network]] for handling voice calls and text
- A [[Packet Switching|packed swtiched network]] for handling mobile data
- The public switched telephone network to connect subscribers to the wider telephony network
