DOCSIS is an international telecommuncation standard that permits the addition of high-bandwidth data transfer to an existing CATV system (Cable). It is used by many cable television operators to provide cable internet access over their exsting  [[Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial (HFC)]] infrastructure.

DOCSIS is one way you get internet into your home via a modem. Future DOCSIS versions replaced [[Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)|DSL]] which was created by telephone companies to combat DOCSIS cable modems.
