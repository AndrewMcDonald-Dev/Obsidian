A cellular network is a telecommunications network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless and the network is distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver. These base statsion provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of cotent. A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed serivce quality within each cell.

Celluarl networks offer a number of desirable features:

- More capacity than a single large transmitter, since the same frequency can be used for multiple links as long as they are in different cells.
- Mobile devices use less poower than a single transmitter or satellite since the cell towers are closer
- Larger converage area than a single terrestial transmitter, since additiaonl cell towers can beadded indefinitely and are not limited by the horizon.
- Capability of utilizing higher frequency signals (and thus more available bandwidth/faster data rates) that are not able to propagate at long distance
- With data compression and multiplexing, several vvideo (including digital video) and audio channels may travel through a higher frequency signal on a single wideband carrier

## 0G

Retroactively called 0G, Mobile radio telephone systems were mobile telephony systems that preceded modern cellualr network technology. Since they were the predcessors of the first generation of cellular telephones, these systems are sometimes retroactively referred to as pre-cellular. These mobile telephones were usually mounted in cars or trucks.

## 1G

1G refers to the first generation cellular network technology. These are mobile telecommunications standards that were introduced in the 1980s and were superseded by 2G. The main difference between these two mobile cellular generations is that the audio transmissions of 1G networks were analog, while 2G networks were entirely digital.

## 2G

2G was the generation of cellular networks that went completely digital. The most common 2G technologies was the TDMA-based [[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)|GSM]] standard, used in most of the world outside Japan. In North America, CDMA was dominant but GSM was also used.

The main advantages of 2G over their 1G predecessors was:

1. Digitally encrypted phone conversations, at least between the mobile phone and the cellualr base station but not necessarily in the rest of the network.
2. Significantly more efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum enabling more users per frequency band.
3. Data services for mobile, starting with [[Short Message Service (SMS)|SMS]] text messaegs then expanding to [[Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)|MMS]]  

With General Packed Radio Service (GPRS), 2G offers a theoretical maximum transfer speed of 40 kbit/s. With [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE)|EDGE]], there is a theoretical maximum transfer speed of 384 kbit/s. Over its lifespan 2G was updated to nicknamed 2.5G, 2.75G, and 2.875G.

## 3G

The first 3G networks were introduced in 2001. Its main appeal was higher transfer rates, and better voice quality. 3G telecommunications networks had a transfer rate oof at least 144 kbit/s. Later in 3G's lifespan some modifications were made called [[High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)|3.5hG]] and [[High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)#Evolved High Speed Packed Access|3.75G]]. These modifications offered several Mbit/s to smartphones and mobile modems. This ensures it is adequate fore wireless voice calls, mobile Internet access, fixed wireless Internet access, video calls and mobile TV technologies.

In North America and South Korea [[Code-Division Multiple Access (CDMA)|CDMA2000]] systems were used. In other parts of the world [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)|UMTS]] systems were used. 

To achieve the generational increase over 2G, 3G utilizes spread spectrum radio transmission technology.

## 4G/LTE

Potential and current applications of 4G systems include mobile web access, IP telophony, gaming services, high-definition mobile TV, video conferencing, and 3D television. In an effot to conglomerate the various cellular network standards the definition of 4G was expanded to include [[Long Term Evolution (LTE)|LTE]], [[Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX)|WiMAX]], and [[High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)#Evolved High Speed Packed Access (HSPA+)|HSPA+]].

Each generation of wireless cellualr technoljogy has introduced increased bandwidth speeds and network capacity. 4G has speeds of up to 150 Mb/s download and 50 Mb/s upload, whereas 3G had a peak speed of 7.2 Mb/s download and 2 Mb/s upload. Theoretically 4G can achieve up to 1 Gb/s for stationary users.

As of 2022, 4G technology accounted for 60 percent of all mobile connections worldwide.

Unlike 3G, which is based on two parallel infrastructures consisting of [[Circuit Switching|Circuit Switched]] and [[Packet Switching|Packet Switched]] network nodes, 4G is based on packed switching only. This requires low-latency data transmission. In addition, 4G is the first generation to fully support [[Internet Protocol (IP)#IPv6|IPv6]]. 

4G has various enhancement including 4.5G also known as [[Long Term Evolution (LTE)#LTE+|LTE+]] and 4.9G also now as [[Long Term Evolution (LTE)#LTE-A Pro|LTE-A Pro]].

## 5G

5G has higher bandwidth to deliver faster speeds than 4G and can connect more devices, improving the quality of Internet serivces in crowded areas. Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected that 5G networks will be the main internet service providers (ISP), competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet [[Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)|DOCSIS]], and also will make possible new applications in [[Internet-Of-Things (IoT)]] and machine-to-machine areas. Cellphones with 4G capability are unable to use the 5G networks. 

Low-band 5G uses a similar frequency range to 4G cellphones, 600-900 MHz, which can potentially offer higher download speeds than 4G. Low-band cell towers cover the same area as 4G towers. Mid-Band 5G uses microwaves of 1.7-4.7 GHz, allowing speeds of 100-900 Mbit/s, with aech cell tower providing service up to several kilometers in radius. This is the most widely deployed level of service. High-band 5G uses frequencies of 24-47 GHz, near the bottom of the millimeter wave band, although higer frequencies may be used in the future. High-band cell towers offer the highest speeds but have a more limited range.

5G wireless power, which is a technology that transfers power wirelessly, has been proven to transmit up to 6Î¼W of power at a distance of 180m. This is a very small amount of power but [[Internet-Of-Things (IoT)]] devices could benefit from this technology given their low power requirements that are within the range of what has been achieved using 5G power capture.

There is an extension to 5G currently in development called 5G-A which is expected to appear in commercial products in mid-2024.

## 6G

6G is the planned successor of 5G and is currently in the early stages of the standardization process. 6G will likely been significantly faster than previous generations, thanks to furthern improvements in radio interface modulation and coding techniques, as well as physical-layer technologies. Other goals include network simplification and increased interoperability, lower latency, and energy efficiency. 

6G should enable network operators to adopt flexible decentralized business models for 6G, with local spectrum licensing, spectrum sharing, infrastructure sharing, and intelligent automated management. Some have proposed that [[Artificial Intelligence (AI)|AI]] systems can be leveraged to support these functions. 

6G networks are expected to be deveolped and released by the early 2030s. The frequency bands for 5G are undetermined. The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)|IEEE]] states that "Frequencies from 100 GHz to 3 THz are promising bands for the next generation of wireless communication systems because fo the wide swath of unused and unexplored spectrum."
