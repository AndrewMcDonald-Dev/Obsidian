Circuit switching is a method of implementing a telecommunications network in which two network nodes establish a dedicated communications channel through the network before the nodes may communicate. The circuit guarantees the full bandwidth of the channel and remains connected for the duration of the communication session. 

When a [[Cellular Network#3G|3G Cellular Network]] handles voice calls and text it uses a circuit switched network. This was in addition to [[Packet Switching]] for the mobile data. Later iterations ([[Cellular Network#4G/LTE|4G]] and beyond) switched to a completely packet switched model.
