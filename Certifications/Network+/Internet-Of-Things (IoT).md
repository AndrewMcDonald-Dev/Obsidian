Internet of things (IoT) describes devices with sensors, processing ability, software and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or oother communication networks. "Internet of things" has been considered a misnomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet; they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.

IoT is most synonymous with "smart home" products, inculding devices and appliances that support one or more common ecoosystems and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in the healthcare system.
