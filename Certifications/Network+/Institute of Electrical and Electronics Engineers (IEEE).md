IEEE is an American professional association for electronics engineering, electrical engineering, and other related disciplines.

The American Institute of Eletrical Engineering was founded in 1884 and the rival Institute of Radio Engineers was formed in 1912. These two institutions competed for several decades before merging in 1963. As of 2023, IEEE has over 460,000 members in 190 countries, with more than 66 percent from outside the United States.

The IEEE claims to produce over 30% of the world's literature in the electrical, electronics, and computer engineering fields. The IEEE has restricted access to its papers to Huawei employees in 2019 due to a U.S. government set of sanctions against Huawei and took a stance against the Russian government after the invasion of Ukraine.
