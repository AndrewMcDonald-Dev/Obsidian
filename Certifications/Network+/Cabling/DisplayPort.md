DisplayPort is a proprietary digital display interface. It is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor. It can also carry audio, USB, and other forms of data. DisplayPort was designed to replace [[Video Graphics Array (VGA)|VGA]], FPD-Link, and [[Digital Visual Interface (DVI)]] and [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)]], through the use of either active or passive adapters.

It is the first display interface to rely on packetized data transmission, a form of digital communication found in technologies such as [[802.3 (Ethernet)|Ethernet]], [[Universal Serial Bus (USB)|USB]], and [[Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI)#PCIe|PCI Express]]. It permits the use of internal and external display connections. Unlike legacy standards that transmit a clock signal with each output, its protocol is based on small [[Packet|data packets]] known as micro packets, which can embed the clock signal in the data stream, allowing higher resolution using fewer pins. 

## 1.0 to 1.1

The first two versions of display port were created within 1 year of each other. The maximum bandwidth of these versions is 10.8 Gbit/s with a cable of up to 2 meters in length. 

## 1.2

Introduced in 2010, version 1.2 featured a significant improvement to the data rate by hitting up to 17.28 Gbit/s which allows increased resolutions, higher refresh rates, and greater color depth. 

## 1.3

Approved in 2014, this standard increases overall transmission bandwidth to 32.4 Gbit/s allowing for 4K UHD display at 120 HZ with 24 bit/px RGB color. This standard includes mandatory Dual-mode for [[Digital Visual Interface (DVI)|DVI]] and [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI)|HDMI]] adapters, implementing the HDMI 2.0 standard and HDCP 2.2 content protection. The [[Thunderbolt#Thunderbolt 3|Thunderbolt 3 ]] connection standard was originally to include Display Port 1.3 capability, but the final release endud up with only 1.2.

## 1.4

Published in 2016, DP 1.4 did not introduce any new transmission modes but added support for Display Stream Compression, Forward Error Correction, etc.

## 2.0

DP 2.0 was released in 2019 with an up to 3x improvement in data rate (77.37 Gbit/s). This comes as well with new capabilities to address the future performance requirements of traditional displays. These included 8K resolutions, higher refresh rates, and [[High Dynamic Range (HDR)|high dynamic range (HDR)]] support at higher resolutions, improved support for multiple display configurations, as well as improved user experience with augmented/virtual reality displays.

## 2.1

The intention behind DP 2.1, announced in 2022, was conformity with the USB Type-C specification so [[Universal Serial Bus (USB)#USB4|USB4]] and [[Thunderbolt]] could more easily tunnel DP support allowing for higher degree of standardization with all of these connectors. Some of these changes are new 40 Gbit/s and 80 Gbit/s modes like USB4 and Thunderbolt 4 offers.
