Coaxial cable, or coax, is a type of eletrical cable consisting of an inner conductor surrounded by a concentric conducing shield, with two separated by a dielectric; many coaxil cables also have a protective outer sheath or jacket.

Coaxial cable is a type of transmission line, used to carry high-frequency eletrical signals with low losses. It is used in such applications as telephone trunk lines, broadband internet networking cables, high-speed computer data busses, cable television singals, and connecting radio transmitters and receivers to their antennas.
