Hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) is a broadband telecommunication network that combines [[Optical Fiber|optical fiber]] and [[Coaxial Cable|coaxial cable]]. It has been commonly employed globally by cable television operators since the the early 1990s.

The fiberoptic trunk lines provide enough bandwidth to allow additional bandwidth-intensive services such as cable internet access through [[Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)|DOCSIS]]. Bandwidth is shared among users of an HFC. Encryption is used to prevent eavesdropping.

The fiber optic networks extends from the cable operators' master headend, sometimes to regional headends, and out to a neighborhoods's hubsite, and finally to an optical to coaxial cable node which typically serves 25 to 2000 homes.
