In fiber-optic communciations, a single-mode optical fiber is an [[Optical Fiber]] designed to carry only a single mode of light - the tranverse mode. This wire can deliver 10 Gbit/s over thousands of kilometers or 40 Gbit/s at several hundred kilometers.

Single-Mode optical fiber uses LASERs as its transmission medium.
