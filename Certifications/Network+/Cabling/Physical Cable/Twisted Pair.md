Twisted pair cabling is a type of communications cable in which two conductors of a single circuit are twisted together for the purposes of improving electromagnetic compatibility. Compared to a single conductor or an untwisted balanced pair, a twisted pair reduces electromagnetic radiation from the pair and crosstalk between neighbouring pairs and improves rejection of external eletromagnetic interference. 

Twisted pair cables may incorporate shielding in an attempt to prevent electromagnetic interference. Shielding provides an eletrically conductive barrier to attenuate electromagnetic waves external to the shield. Unshielded twisted pair is often abbreviated to UTP and shielded is STP.

Examples of UTP are Cat 5e, Cat 6/6A, and Cat 8/8.1 while STP would be Cat 7/7A. All of these do have an additional foil shielding sometimes referred to FTP.
