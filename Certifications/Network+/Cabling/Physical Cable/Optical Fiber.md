An optical fiber is a flexible glass or plastic fiber that can transmit light from one end to the other. Such fibers find wide suage in fiber-optic communications, where they permit transmission over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than electrical cables. Fibers are used instead of metal wires because signals travel along them with less loss and are immune to electromagnetic interference.
