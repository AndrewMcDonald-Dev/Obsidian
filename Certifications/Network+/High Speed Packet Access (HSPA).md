HSPA is an amalgamation of two mobile protocols -- [[High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)#High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)|High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)]] and [[High Speed Packet Access (HSPA)#High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA)|High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA)]] -- that extends and improves the performances of existing [[Cellular Network#3G|3G]] mobile telecommunication networks using the WCDMA protocols.

#### High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)

HSDPA is an enhanced 3G mobile communications protocol in the HSPA family which allows networks based on [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)]] to have higher data speeds and capacity. HSDPA also decreases latency, and therefore the round-trip time for applications.

To update to HSDPA is often just a software update for already in place networks. In HSDPA, voice calls are usually prioritized over data transfer.


#### High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA)

HSUPA is an enhanced 3G mobile communications protocol in the HSPA family which allows networks based on [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS)]] to have higher data speeds, capacity, and reduce latency. In addition to these improvement, this allows for new features such as [[Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)]], uploading pictures, and sending large e-mail messages.


## Evolved High Speed Packed Access (HSPA+)


Evolved HSPA, also known as 3.75G,  is a wireless broadband standard which is an upgrade to HSPA. It features expansions to the existing HSPA definitions and is therefore backward compatible all the way to the original 3G release. 

HSPA+ serves as a stepping stone for telcom operators to migrate towards 4G. In between HSPA+ and [[Cellular Network#4G/LTE|4G]] is [[Long Term Evolution (LTE)]].

Both HSDPA and HSUPA have HSPA+ counterparts called HSDPA+ and HSUPA+ respectively. Both of these protocols features higher rates and provide an outsized increase for end users in areas of poor radio reception where they cannot benefit from other capacity improvements.
