X.25 is a standard protocol suite for [[Packet Switching|packet-switched]] data communication in [[Wide Area Networks (WAN)]]. The protocol suite is designed as three conceptual layers, which correspond closely to the lower three layers of the [[OSI Model]], although it was deveolped several yares before the OSI Model.

The general concept of the X.25 was to create a universal and global packet-switched network. Much of the X.25 system is a description of the rigorous error correction needes to achieve this, as well as more efficient sharing of capital-intensive physical resources.
