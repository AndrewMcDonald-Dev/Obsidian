# Day 2 of Rust


## Variables and Mutability

The reason for varaibles and references being imutable is to push your code towards the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

When we run this new code we get this error:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.
error: could not compile `variables` due to previous error
```

The compiler is very good at finding errors in our program before it finishes. 

Having to explicitly type mut is also good because it lets someone reading our code to understand it easier.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 5
The value of x is: 6
```

By adding mut our program now works.

#### Constants

Instead of using the let keywork we can use const and get a similar value to an immutable variable. Constants are always immutable and there data type must be explicitly annotated. They also can be declared in any scope including global scope which is nice for being used across the program. Finally, Constants can only be assigned to a constant expression which is one not computed at runtime. 

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
	const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
}
```

The convention for constants is to write them in all uppercase seperated by underscores.
The compiler can do a limited set of operations which allows us to write the code in an easier to understand way.

Constants can never be altered to they are valid for the entire time a program runs inside their scope.

#### Shadowing

This is the concept that when a variable is declared with the same name as another variable the original variable becomes *shadowed* by the second. The compiler will only see the most recent one. This new variable will remain the variable seen by the compiler until another variable is declared over it or its scope ends.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;

    let x = x + 1;

    {
        let x = x * 2;
        println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
    }

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

This program first binds x to a value of 5. Then a new variable called x is created that uses the old variable x in the expression. Within an inner scope  another x variable is declared that uses the previous variable in the expression. This x variable is printed and then its scope ends so the previous x variable is in use again. 

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
The value of x is: 6
```

It is importatn to note that Rust allows you to just use the curly braces to establish another layer of scope without any function or statement in use.

Mut is generally used when the variable that is being declared is the same type as th previous so instead we simply change the value. Shadowing may also be used if the two expressions are meaningfully different while still being the same type.

Example of when to use shadowin
```rust 
fn main() {
    let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
}
```
The two spaces varaibles are different types so shadowing is preferred so we can still use the simpler *spaces* name instead of unique names for both.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut spaces = "   ";
    spaces = spaces.len();
}
```

This is an improper use of mut and compiling the program results in:
```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:3:14
  |
2 |     let mut spaces = "   ";
  |                      ----- expected due to this value
3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
  |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `variables` due to previous error
```


## Data Types

Every value in Rust has a certain data type and we will look al two data type subsets: scalar and compound. Rust generally infers the type but when multiple types are available we have to explicitly type the variable. 

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
	let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
}
```
If we don't hade the type declaration there then we will get the error:
```rust
$ cargo build
   Compiling no_type_annotations v0.1.0 (file:///projects/no_type_annotations)
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> src/main.rs:2:9
  |
2 |     let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
  |         ^^^^^ consider giving `guess` a type

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0282`.
error: could not compile `no_type_annotations` due to previous error
```

#### Scalar Types

A *scalar* type represets a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: Integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. 

###### Integer Types

An integer is a number without a fractional component. When selecting an integer type there are two customizable parts. First is the identifying character of either i meaning signed or u meaning unsigned. Also you can customize the size of this integer with a number after the character that includes 8, 16, 32, 64, 128.

Also note that there is size option that sets to the default size of operating system.
<table><thead><tr><th>Length</th><th>Signed</th><th>Unsigned</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i8</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u8</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>16-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i16</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u16</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>32-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i32</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u32</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>64-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i64</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u64</code></td></tr>

<tr><td>arch</td><td><code class="hljs">isize</code></td><td><code class="hljs">usize</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

Also note that there are Number Literals:
<table><thead><tr><th>Length</th><th>Signed</th><th>Unsigned</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>8-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i8</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u8</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>16-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i16</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u16</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>32-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i32</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u32</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>64-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i64</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u64</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>128-bit</td><td><code class="hljs">i128</code></td><td><code class="hljs">u128</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>arch</td><td><code class="hljs">isize</code></td><td><code class="hljs">usize</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

###### Floating-Point Types

There are also two floating point primitives called f32 and f64 with the default being the larger version since there is only a small compromise in speed with a lot of added percision.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

###### Numeric Operations

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5 + 10;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4 * 30;

    // division
    let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
    let floored = 2 / 3; // Results in 0

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43 % 5;
}
```

###### Boolean Type

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

###### Character Type

```rust 
fn main() {
    let c = 'z';
    let z: char = 'â„¤'; // with explicit type annotation
    let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

We specify char literals with single quotes, as opposed to string literals, which use double quotes. Rust chart type is four bytes and represents a Unicode Scalar Value which represents a lot more than ASCII.

#### Compound Types

*Compound types* can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrarys.

###### Tuple Type

A tuple is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: once declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values insied parentheses and state the types with the same syntax where types are normally declared.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

The variable tup binds to the entire tuple, because a tuple is considered a sintle compound element. To get the individualt valuse out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destruture a tuple value, like this.

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the varaible tup. It then uses a pattern with let to take tup and turn it into three separate variables, x, y, and z. This is *destructuring*, because it breaks the single tuple into three parts.

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period ( . ) followed by the index of the value we want to access. Ex:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

This program creates the tuple x and then accesses each element of the tuple using their respective indices. 

The tuple without any values has a special name, *unit*. This value ant its corresponding type are both written () and represent an empty value or an empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don't return any other value.

###### Array Type

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an *array*. Arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocted on the stack rather than the heap or when you want to ensure you always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn't as flexible as the vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the standard library that *is* allowed to grow or shrink in size. If you're unsure whether to use an array or a vector, chancer are you should ure a vector.

Arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not need to change. 

You write an array's type using square brackets with the type of each element, a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
	let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

This array is annotated by being type i32 with size 5.

You can alos initialize an array to contain the same value for each elemnt by specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of the array in square brackets, as shown here: 

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
	let a = [3; 5];
}
```

How to access array element:

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    let first = a[0];
    let second = a[1];
}
```

If you try to access an element of an array that if past the end of the array like in:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("Please enter an array index.");

    let mut index = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut index)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    let index: usize = index
        .trim()
        .parse()
        .expect("Index entered was not a number");

    let element = a[index];

    println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
}
```

This code compiles successfully. If you run and enter 0-4 the program will print out the corresponding value but, if instead you give something past that index the output will be:

```rust
thread 'main' panicked at 'index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10', src/main.rs:19:19
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

The program resulted in a *runtime* error. This has to happen at runtime because the compiler  can't possibly know what index will be given then.

This is an example of Rust's memory safety principles in action. In many low-level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. 


## Functions

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

Since Rust is a compiled language we are able to use function before they are defined.

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
Hello, world!
Another function.
```

Important to note that the lines of code execute in the order they appear in the main function.


#### Parameters

For functions we can define *parameters* which are values passed to the function.

```rust
fn main() {
    another_function(5);
}

fn another_function(x: i32) {
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
```

In function signatures, you must declare the type of each parameter. This is a deliberaate decision in Rust's design: requiring type annotations in function definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in the code to figure out what type you mean.

Example with multiple parameters:
```rust
fn main() {
    print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
}

fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
    println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
}
```

#### Statements and Expressions

*Statements* are instructions that perform some actin and do not return a value. *Expressions* evaluate to a resulting value. Let's look at some examples.

Weâ€™ve actually already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable and assigning a value to it with theÂ `let`Â keyword is a statement. In Listing 3-1,Â `let y = 6;`Â is a statement.

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can't assign a `let` statement to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you'll get an error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = (let y = 6);
}
```

When you run this program, the error you'll get looks like this:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)

warning: `functions` (bin "functions") generated 1 warning
error: could not compile `functions` due to 2 previous errors; 1 warning emitted
```

The `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn't anything for `x`  to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In thoes languages, you can write `x = y = 6` and have both `x` and `y` have the value `6`; that is not the case in Rust.

Expressions do evaluate to a value and make up most other operations in Rust. Expressions can be part of statements: in Listing 3-1, theÂ `6`Â in the statementÂ `let y = 6;`Â is an expression that evaluates to the valueÂ `6`. Calling a function is an expression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with curly brackets is an expression, for example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let y = {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    };

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

This expression:

```rust
{
    let x = 3;
    x + 1
}
```

is a blodk that, in this case, evaluates to `4`. That value gets boudn to `y` as part of the `let` statement.

#### Functions with Return Values

Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don't name return values, but we must declare their type after an arrow ( `->` ). In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a function by using the `return` keywork and specifying a value.

```rust
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

fn main() {
    let x = five();

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```

This code runs and generates the expected output:

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
The value of x is: 5
```

Another example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Running this code will print `The value of x is: 6`. But if we palce a semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1` , changing it from an expression to a statement, we'll get an error.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1;
}
```

```bash
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
error[E0308]: mismatched types

The core issue here is mismatched types because statements don't evaluate to a value, which is expressed by `()` , the unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned throwing and error in the process.
