# Music Notation

## Clefs

Describe the treble clef::The treble clef is the most commonly used clef in music notation. The treble clef is noted by the G note is on the 2nd line from the bottom. The symbol of a treble clef is called the G clef by the swirl always indicating where the G note is.

Describe the bass clef::The bass clef is used for instruments that are on the lower end of frequencies for the human ear. It has two dots on either side of the fourth line of the staff indicating the location of F. This is a specific form of a F clef where the two dots point to wherever the F is on the staff.

Describe the C clef::The C clef is unique from the G and F clef because there is no dominant version that is more recognizable than the others. The groove or opening of these clefs always indicates middles C. For each line starting from the bottom if the groove lands on it the name of the clefs change respectively to soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, tenor, baritone.

Given the notes on the lines in ascending order for the treble clef::E, G, B, D, F.

# Time Values

What is the shape of a whole note::Wide hollow circle centered on the note.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,274-->

What is the shape of a half note::Wide hollow circle centered on the note with a stem.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,282-->

What is the shape of a quarter note::Wide filled circle centered on the note with a stem.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,270-->

What is the shape of a eighth note::Wide filled circle centered on the note with a stem and one flag.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,283-->

What is the shape of a whole rest::Rectangle hanging off the bottom of the 4th bar line.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,283-->

What is the shape of a half rest::Rectangle sitting on top of the 3rd bar line.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,283-->

What is the shape of a quarter rest::Squigly centered to the 5 bar lines.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,274-->

How to notes/rests scale past the eighth variation::With the eighth variation starting as one the notes as they progress to 16th etc... add an extra flag with each doubling. Rests add another eighth rest to the bottom of the previous.
<!--SR:!2023-12-07,103,294-->

When do stems point up or down::The stems point up from the 3rd bar line and below. Stems point down above the 3rd bar line and above.
<!--SR:!2023-11-30,20,314-->

What does beaming notes together mean::Notes with flags may be connected to one another replacing the flag with a solid line that connects the top of the notes with the amount beams relating to the amount of flags. Notes with different amount of flags can be connected in certain scenarios.
<!--SR:!2023-08-02,3,254-->

What is the relationship between note lengths generally and then equate 1 whole note to a number of eighth notes::Notes as go in shorter duration are half the duration of the last note. So a whole note is equal to 8 eighth notes. This same relationship works with rests.
<!--SR:!2023-09-15,20,303-->

What note is the standard time keeping note length::The quarter note.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,274-->

What is the purpose of dotting notes. Explain the length of a dotted half note in two ways::Dotting notes is shorthand for representing a length of time equating to 1.5 of the note. So a dotted half note is equal to a half note and quarter note in duration or 3 quarter notes in duration. 
<!--SR:!2023-09-15,20,294-->

How do you draw a dot for notes on and off the bar lines::If the note is in between bar lines the dot goes directly to the right of the note. If the note is on a bar line the dot goes in the space above.
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,283-->

How do you draw a dot for rests::For every rest the dot goes on the 3rd space from the bottom.
<!--SR:!2023-07-31,1,243-->

What is another way to indicate a longer duration than dotting a note or using a longer note::Tieing together two notes that are the same sound simply increases the duration of the note. This is used when the note is played across a measure. 
<!--SR:!2023-08-03,4,283-->

When some of the notes' stems go up and others go down how do we beam together these notes::The note farthest from the third line is the format you follow for every note being beamed together.
