International summit of the six great powers of that time (Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy, and Russia) convened in December 1912 due to the successes of the [Balkan League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_League) armies against the Ottoman Empire in the first Balkan War. In particular, the conference intended to arbitrate between the warring powers as to territorial acquisitions, and also to determine the future of Albania, whose independence was proclaimed during the conflict.
