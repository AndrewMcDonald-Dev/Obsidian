- The roots of this conflict is the [[Expulsion of the Albanians 1877-1878]]
- Tensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo had erupted into violence on multiple occasions.
	- This violence generally happened during major wars such as he [First Balkan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Balkan_War "First Balkan War") (1912–13), [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") (1914–18), and [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") (1939–45).
	- The [[Albanian revolt of 1912]] in Kosovo resulted in the Ottoman Empire agreeing to the creation of an Albanian quasi-state. Soon after opportunistic Bulgarian, Serbian, and Montenegrin forces pushed out the Ottoman forces.
	- In the ensuing [Balkan Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars), at least 50,000 Albanians were massacred in Kosovo by the Serbian regular army.
	- This massacre was done to influence the drawing of borders for Albania during the [[London Conference of 1912-1913]].
- After WWI Kosovo was incorporated into the Serb-dominated  [Kingdom of Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia "Kingdom of Yugoslavia") despite the Albanian community's demands for union of Albania.
	- Albania rebels started the [[Drenica-Dukagjin Uprisings]], which ending with the rebellion being crushed after the fall of the government of [[Fan Noli]] in Albanian in December 1924.
	- Between 1918 and 1939, Yugoslavia expelled hundreds of thousands of Albanians and promoted mostly Serb colonists in the region.
	- After the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. 
	- During the occupation, Albanian collaborators persecutor Serb and Montenegrin settlers, with thousands killed and between 70k and 100k expelled from Kosovo or sent to concentration camps in order to Albanianize the province. 
	- The return of the expelled colonists was made next to impossible by a decree from Yugoslav leader [Josip Broz Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito), followed by a new law in August 1945, which disallowed the return of colonists who had taken land from Albanian peasants.
