A series of Albanian uprisings in the Kosovo regions of Drenica and Dukagjin from 1919 to 1924. The uprisings began after the end of WWI when Kosovo remained part of the new [Kingdom of Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Yugoslavia "Kingdom of Yugoslavia"). Parts of the Albanian population which resisted Yugoslav rule formed the Kachak movement under the leadership of theÂ [Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_National_Defence_of_Kosovo "Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo") and conducted guerilla attacks. A 1919 revolt in Drenica involving 10,000 people was quelled by the Yugoslav army, but uprisings continued in the following years.

In response, Yugoslav authorities committed atrocities against the Albanian population, which included massacres, destruction of villages and looting. It is estimated that approximately 12,000 Kosovo Albanians were killed fro 1918 to 1921. By 1924, military confrontations between Albanians and Serbs ended as the Kachak movement was effectively suppressed.
