- Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia and Montenegro) VS. Kosovo Liberation Army
	- Conflict ended when NATO intervened with air strikes in early 1999. Resulting in Yugoslavia withdrawing from Kosovo. 
- KLA formed to fight against discrimination of ethnic Albanians and suppression of Kosovo's autonomy in the early 1990s.
	- The KLA's first campaign started when Kosovo's case was left out of the [[Dayton Agreement]] 
	- In 1996 the KLA started attacking Serbian governmental buildings and police stations which was a precursor to the Kosovo War.
	- The KLA received a large number of weapons in 1997 by smuggling arms from Albania after a rebellion. 
	- In 1998 the KLA started attacks targeting Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo which resulted in increased presence of Serb paramilitaries who subsequently began pursuing a campaign of retribution resulting in the deaths of 1500-2000 civilians and KLA combatants and displaced 370,000 Kosovar Albanians.
	- On 20 March 1999, Yugoslav forces began a massive campaign of repression and expulsions or Kosovar Albanians.
		- This occurred following a withdrawal of the OCSE Kosovo Verification Missions and the failure of the proposed [[Rambouillet Agreement]].
- NATO intervened with an aerial bombing campaign which it justified as a "humanitarian war"
- The war ended with the [[Kumanovo Agreement]], signed on 9 June, with Yugoslav and Serb forces agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo agreeing to withdraw from Kosovo to make way for an international presence.
	- NATO forces entered Kosovo on June 12.
	- The NATO bombing campaign has remained controversial. It did not gain the approval of the UN Security Council and it caused at least 488 Yugoslav civilian deaths, including substantial numbers of Kosovar refugees.
- In 2001 a Supreme Court, based in Kosovo and administered by the United Nations, found that there had been "a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons, and severe maltreatments", but that Yugoslav troops had tried to remove rather than eradicate the Albanian population.
- The Yugoslav forces and Serb forces caused the displacement of 1.2 and 1.45 mil Kosovo Albanians. 
- After the war, around 200,000 Serbs, Romani, and other non-Albanians fled Kosovo and many of the remaining civilians were victims of abuse.
- The KLA disbanded soon after the end of the war, with some of its members going on to fight for the [UÇPMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Army_of_Pre%C5%A1evo,_Medve%C4%91a_and_Bujanovac "Liberation Army of Preševo, Medveđa and Bujanovac") in the [Preševo Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre%C5%A1evo_Valley "Preševo Valley") and others joining the National Liberation Army (NLA) and Albanian National Army (ANA) during the armed ethnic conflict in Macedonia, while others went to the Kosovo Police.
- [[The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)]] convicted six Serb/Yugoslav officials for war crimes, and one Albanian commander for war crimes.
